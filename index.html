                    <h2>About us:</h2>
                    <p>
                    OCRP is an 18+ FiveM role playing community. We have 2 servers, a "life-rp" server, and a relaxed RP server. This means you make your characters' stories how you want and you can also RP how you want. We pride ourselves on having NO RANKS. Ranked communities are toxic, ripe for power-hungry people, and create a useless "game out of the game" environment. Everyone is under the same permissions, admins included. You are equal the day you get membership to members who have been in since BETA. If you are looking for rank, status, or power, this is not the place for you.
